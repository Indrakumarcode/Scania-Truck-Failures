# Scania-Truck-Failures
Project Overview: Scania Truck Failure Analysis and Predictive Maintenance System
The Scania Truck Failure Analysis and Predictive Maintenance System aims to develop a comprehensive solution for monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting failures in Scania trucks. By utilizing data analytics, machine learning (ML), and predictive modeling, this project seeks to minimize the operational downtime of Scania trucks by detecting potential issues before they become critical failures, thus optimizing the maintenance processes.

The project focuses on leveraging historical truck performance data, real-time sensor readings, and diagnostic reports to build a model that predicts the likelihood of specific failures. It will allow fleet managers and operators to proactively address issues, leading to reduced maintenance costs, improved vehicle performance, and enhanced safety.
